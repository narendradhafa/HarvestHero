### Home Gardening Education and Tracker Mobile App

In Indonesia, the agricultural sector is predominantly sustained by elderly farmers, a demographic trend that underscores the urgent need for engaging the younger generation. The reduction in agricultural land has necessitated the adoption of home gardening systems. Despite the critical importance of agriculture, there has been a noticeable decline in interest among children and teenagers in pursuing farming activities. Based on data from the BPS in 2023, around 70% of farmers are aged 43 to 77 years, with 27.61% of farmers belonging to the Baby Boomer generation (aged 59 to 77 years) and 42.39% of farmers belonging to Generation X (aged 43 to 58 years).

To address this issue, we have developed an application that makes gardening easy and fun by providing step-by-step guides based on the type of plant selected by the user through searching or detecting the seed with machine learning. The application also enables users to track the plants they have grown.
